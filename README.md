## Introduction

The violence detection model aims to identify violent activities in videos. This model leverages deep learning techniques for feature extraction and sequence modeling to detect violent behavior effectively.

## Dataset

- Here is a notebook that I contributed to the Kaggle community for violence detection Dataset: [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thesuriya/violence-detection)
- Dataset that i used for traininng a model[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedmustafa/real-life-violence-situations-dataset)

## Features

- Feature extraction using Inception V3
- Sequence modeling using LSTM
- Built with TensorFlow
- End-to-end implementation in a single Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/violence-detection-notebook.git
    cd violence-detection-notebook
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. required packages:
    ```bash
    !pip install opencv-python
    !pip tensorflow
    !pip numpy
    !pip tqdm
    ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. Open the notebook `violence_detection.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.

## Usage

Run the cells in the `violence_detection.ipynb` notebook sequentially. The notebook includes steps for data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The model requires a dataset of videos labeled as violent or non-violent. The dataset should be organized as follows:

```bash
dataset/
violent/
video1.mp4
video2.mp4
...
non_violent/
video1.mp4
video2.mp4

...
```
Make sure to update the notebook with the correct path to your dataset.

### Feature Extraction

- **Inception V3**: Pre-trained on ImageNet, used for extracting features from video frames.

### Sequence Modeling

- **LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequence classification.

The model is built using TensorFlow's Sequential API.

## Training and Evaluation

The notebook (`violence_detection.ipynb`) contains all steps for training and evaluating the model. Follow the instructions within the notebook to train the model on your dataset and evaluate its performance.

## Results

Include a summary of your model's performance in this section. You can also add visualizations and metrics obtained from the notebook, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
